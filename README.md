Very simple student information system.

Include functions as:
- Adding every new entry into external text file named 'student.txt'.
- List all actual students in 'class' (text file).
- Find a specific record using keyword - could be name, surname, ID.
- Delete student from file according to its ID. For example --Delete 1: (remove student with ID: 1)

More functions will comes later, maybe. This was made mainly as training of saving input into file and 'deleting' specific record from actual file.
